                    <p class="w-space">The White Shepherd emerged from white-coat lines of the German Shepherd dog in Canada, the United States and from European imports. The White Shepherd breed was officially recognized by the United Kennel Club on April 14, 1999.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-small"><i class="fas fa-dog"></i> Appearance</h3>
                    <p class="w-space">The White Shepherd, as recognized by UKC, is a medium-sized, well-balanced, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a medium length, pure white coat, erect ears, and a low-set natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried in a slight curve like a saber. An average weight for the White Swiss Shepherd is 77-85 lbs (35-40 kg), and an average height is 22-26 inches (55-65 cm) tall. Their life span is 12-13 years.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-small"><i class="fas fa-paw"></i> Temperament</h3>
                    <p class="w-space">The White Shepherd has a distinct personality marked by self-confidence. The breed is poised, but when the situation demands, they are eager, alert and ready to serve in any capacity. White Shepherds demonstrate both herding and protective instincts. With those they know, the White Shepherd is open and friendly. With strangers, they are observant and may be somewhat aloof but not apprehensive. They enjoy running, swimming, playing fetch or any activity with their human family. This is a joyful, active, intelligent and easy to train working dog with the ability to adapt and integrate to all kinds of social events and situations.</p>

                    <p class="w-space">The White Shepherd can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. White Shepherds that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.</p>
